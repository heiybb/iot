The strength of line graph can show the small changes in the data and compare changes over a period of time.
Change of temperature and humidity are the two key elements in the data and they can change rapidly.
As a result, line chart is the most suitable graph to use and also our choice for the analytical tasks (Task d).
 
Graph1 (2019-04-02 Temperature Humidity Line Chart) is the changes of temperature and humidity on 2ndApril.
The data is measured by every two hours. The library that we use for this graph is Matplotlib.
Compare to other libraries, Matplotlib is relatively simple to generate a basic plot.

Graph2 (Temperature Humidity Chart) is comparing the changes in temperature and humidity from 2ndApril to 3rdApril.
In the graph, we show the maximum, minimum and the average temperature, humidity within two days.
We use pyecharts library to generate Graph2. Compare to Matplotlib, pyecharts is more powerful.
It can generate a detail and beautiful chart.
